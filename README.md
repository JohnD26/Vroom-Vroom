# Vroom Vroom: The Autonomous Vehicle Simulator

## Introduction

Vroom Vroom is a C++ project that simulates autonomous vehicles navigating dynamic environments. It features sensor fusion algorithms, basic machine learning models for decision-making, and visualizations.

## Features

- **Sensor Simulation:** Simulate LiDAR, radar, and camera inputs.
- **Sensor Fusion:** Combine sensor data for accurate environment perception.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implement decision-making algorithms.
- **Visualization:** Render environments and vehicles using OpenGL.

## Installation

Instructions will be provided as the project develops.

## Usage

Guidelines on how to run the simulator will be added later.
